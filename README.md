# CSE-598-Project


Commands:  
`pip install poetry` or `pip3 install poetry`  
`poetry update`  
`poetry install`  
`poetry run python example.py`

To avoid headaches, use this command: `poetry env use /full/path/to/python`. It will tell poetry *which* version of Python to use, which will allow using `3.8` which is compatible with tensorflow `1.15.4`
